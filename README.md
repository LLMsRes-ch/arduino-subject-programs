# Codes for the Paper: "Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arduino Code Generation"

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs), also known as Generative AI, have revolutionized code generation by converting natural-language prompts into executable code. However, their capabilities in generating code for **resource-constrained devices** like **Arduino**, which are widely used in **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **embedded systems**, remain underexplored.

This repository contains a **set of 31 Arduino subject programs**, each provided with **two optimized reference solutions**, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating correct, efficient, and high-quality Arduino code. These subject programs support empirical research on LLM performance in microcontroller-based programming environments.

**Code and data are available from the authors upon request.**
